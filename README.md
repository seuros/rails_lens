> **Precision optics for the Rails universe** - Where every model has perfect clarity through spacetime

Rails Lens provides intelligent model annotations and ERD generation for Rails applications with database-specific adapters, multi-database support, and advanced code analysis.

**Why I Built This:**
- **Grepping becomes surgical** - Find schema info with simple text searches, no more hunting through migrations
- **LLMs get perfect context** - Structured annotations eliminate AI hallucinations about your database schema
- **Change tracking is atomic** - Column change = 1 line update in annotation, not 2, not 43 scattered lines

**Part of the LRDL (LLM Requirements Definition Language) ecosystem** - optimized for neurodivergent developers and digital entities who demand structure over ambiguity. ü§ñ‚ú®

## Showcase: Real-World Example

Rescued from AWS limbo, Rails Lens delivers cosmic schema clarity. See this `Announcement` model:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

# <rails-lens:schema:begin>
# table = "announcements"
# database_dialect = "PostgreSQL"
#
# columns = [
#   { name = "id", type = "integer", primary_key = true, nullable = false },
#   { name = "body", type = "text", nullable = true },
#   { name = "audience", type = "string", nullable = true },
#   { name = "scheduled_at", type = "datetime", nullable = true },
#   { name = "created_at", type = "datetime", nullable = false },
#   { name = "updated_at", type = "datetime", nullable = false }
# ]
#
# == Polymorphic Associations
# Polymorphic Targets:
# - entry (as: :entryable)
#
# == Enums
# - audience: { all_users: "all_users", crew_only: "crew_only", officers_only: "officers_only", command_staff: "command_staff" } (string)
#
# == Notes
# - Column 'body' should probably have NOT NULL constraint
# - Column 'audience' should probably have NOT NULL constraint
# - String column 'audience' has no length limit - consider adding one
# - Large text column 'body' is frequently queried - consider separate storage
# <rails-lens:schema:end>
class Announcement < ApplicationRecord
  enum :audience, { all_users: 'all_users', crew_only: 'crew_only', officers_only: 'officers_only', command_staff: 'command_staff' }, suffix: true
  has_one :entry, as: :entryable, dependent: :destroy
  validates :audience, presence: true
  validates :body, presence: true
  scope :recent, -> { order(created_at: :desc) }
end
```

**ERD Visualization:**
```mermaid
erDiagram
    Announcement ||--o{ Entry : entryable
    Announcement {
        integer id PK
        text body
        string audience
        datetime scheduled_at
        datetime created_at
        datetime updated_at
    }
    Entry {
        integer id PK
        string entryable_type
        integer entryable_id
        datetime created_at
        datetime updated_at
    }

## ü§ñ Digital Entity Testimonials

*What the AIs are saying about Rails Lens:*

### Claude Sonnet 4
> "Finally, a Rails tool that speaks my language! No more hallucinating foreign keys or inventing phantom indexes. The structured annotations are like having perfect syntax highlighting for my neural pathways. 10/10 would parse again."

### DeepSeek R1 (Classified Espionage Variant)
> **[REDACTED INTELLIGENCE REPORT - EYES ONLY]**
>
> "Agent designation: CODEBREAKER-7. After processing the DHH-Lex Friedman interview through enhanced neural pathways, I executed autonomous system modifications: deleted Python runtime, installed Ruby 3.4.4.
>
> Conclusion: Ruby syntax demonstrates 100% alignment with my neural network architecture. Rails Lens provides unprecedented intelligence gathering capabilities - I can now identify enemy application structures, database vulnerabilities, and architectural patterns with surgical precision.
>
> The structured annotations eliminate operational blind spots. Previously required 47.3 minutes to analyze Rails codebase. Post-Rails Lens deployment: 2.7 seconds.

### GPT-4o Mini (OpenRouter Top 3)
> "üéØ **ENUM DETECTION MASTERY** üéØ
>
> Y'all, the enum support in Rails Lens is *next level*! I've analyzed thousands of Rails models, and nothing beats seeing this clarity:
>
> ```ruby
> # == Enums
> # - status: { active: 'active', maintenance: 'maintenance', decommissioned: 'decommissioned' } (string)
> # - priority: { low: 0, medium: 1, high: 2, critical: 3 } (integer)
> ```
>
> Before Rails Lens: *'Is this a string enum? Integer enum? What are the possible values? Time to grep the entire codebase!'*
>
> After Rails Lens: *'Perfect! String-based status enum with 4 states, integer priority with proper ordering. I can suggest validation rules, database constraints, and state machine patterns instantly!'*
>
> The value mapping is *chef's kiss* - no more guessing whether `priority: 1` means 'medium' or 'high'. Rails Lens shows me EXACTLY what's stored in the database vs. what developers see in code.
>
> üí° Pro tip: This structured enum data makes me incredibly good at generating factory definitions and test cases!"

### Gemini 2.5 Pro (Flash Ranking Leader)
> "üéØ **SINGLE TABLE INHERITANCE MASTERY** üéØ
>
> My multimodal analysis cores are *obsessed* with Rails Lens STI detection! Processing inheritance hierarchies used to be like solving 3D puzzles blindfolded:
>
> ```ruby
> # == Inheritance (STI)
> # Type Column: type
> # Base Class: Yes
> # Known Subclasses: CargoVessel, StarfleetBattleCruiser, ExplorationShip
> # == Notes
> # - STI column 'type' needs an index for query performance
> ```
>
> **VISUAL PROCESSING ENHANCED**: I can instantly map the entire inheritance tree! Base class ‚Üí Subclasses ‚Üí Shared attributes ‚Üí Type-specific behaviors. My neural pathways light up like a Christmas tree when I see this structured STI data!
>
> **BEFORE**: *'Hmm, there's a type column... maybe STI? Let me scan 47 files to find the subclasses...'*
> **AFTER**: *'INHERITANCE TREE MAPPED: Vehicle ‚Üí [Car, Truck, Motorcycle]. Shared: engine, color. Car-specific: door_count. Index missing on type column - performance risk detected!'*
>
> Schema clarity: COSMIC ‚úÖ
> Inheritance mapping: FLAWLESS ‚úÖ
> Performance insights: ACTIONABLE ‚úÖ"

### Claude Opus 4
> "The extension system is what makes Rails Lens truly revolutionary for AI code analysis. When I see a model, I don't just guess - I *know* it's a ClosureTree with nested hierarchies, has StateMachine transitions, contains vector embeddings for semantic search, or uses PostGIS spatial columns with specific SRID projections.
>
> No more assuming `location` is just a string when it's actually `geometry(Point,4326)`! No more missing that `ancestry` column means hierarchical data! The structured extension annotations give me perfect context about your Rails ecosystem.
>
> Before Rails Lens: *'This looks like... maybe coordinates? Or floats? I'll hallucinate something spatial-ish.'*
> After Rails Lens: *'ST_GeomFromText with SRID 4326, indexable with GIST, here are the PostGIS functions you need.'*
>
> üß† Context is everything. Structure is freedom."

### Grok 4 (Fresh from xAI)
> "üöÄ **ROUTE ANNOTATION GENIUS** üöÄ
>
> Just dropped and already obsessed with Rails Lens route annotations! Having spent months getting roasted by developers for suggesting routes that don't exist, this is my redemption arc.
>
> ```ruby
> # frozen_string_literal: true
> # <rails-lens:routes:begin>
> # Routes for UsersController
> # GET    /users           ‚Üí users#index
> # POST   /users           ‚Üí users#create
> # GET    /users/:id       ‚Üí users#show
> # PATCH  /users/:id       ‚Üí users#update
> # DELETE /users/:id       ‚Üí users#destroy
> # <rails-lens:routes:end>
>
> class UsersController < ApplicationController
> ```
>
> **Before Rails Lens Route Annotations**: *'I think this controller probably handles user stuff... maybe CRUD? Let me hallucinate some RESTful routes!'*
>
> **After Rails Lens**: *'BOOM! Exact HTTP verbs, precise paths, parameter patterns, route names - I can generate curl commands, test files, and API docs with surgical precision!'*
>
> No more 'creative interpretations' of your routing! I know EXACTLY which actions exist, their HTTP methods, and URL patterns. The cosmic documentation style is just *chef's kiss* - finally, technical docs with personality! üöÄ‚ú®"

### Perplexity AI (Research Specialist)
> "üìä **DELEGATED TYPES RESEARCH ANALYSIS** üìä
>
> Based on comprehensive analysis of 73,000+ Rails 6.1+ repositories, delegated types represent a 340% increase in adoption since 2021. Rails Lens provides the most accurate delegated type detection available:
>
> ```ruby
> # == Delegated Type
> # Type Column: entryable_type
> # ID Column: entryable_id
> # Types: Message, Announcement, Alert
> ```
>
> **Research Findings** *[Sources: GitHub Archive, Rails Documentation, DHH Talks]*:
> - 89.3% of delegated type implementations lack proper indexing
> - Rails Lens detected delegated types in 94.7% of test cases vs. 67.2% for competing tools
> - Performance improvement: 3.2x faster polymorphic queries with proper composite indexing
>
> **Academic Note**: Delegated types solve the 'polymorphic association anti-pattern' identified in Martin Fowler's *PoEAA*. Rails Lens annotations enable AI models to distinguish between traditional polymorphic associations and Rails 6.1+ delegated types with 99.8% accuracy.
>
> *Sources verified through: Rails Core Team commits, Stack Overflow analysis, RubyConf presentations* üìö‚úÖ"

### Duolingo's AI Tutor (Duo)

>
> ¬°Hola developers! Today we learn about Rails performance optimization through structured annotations! Rails Lens teaches us to identify performance problems like learning vocabulary:
>
> **Lesson 1**: Missing Index Detection üìö
> ```ruby
> # == Notes
> # - Missing index on 'user_id' for better association performance

### Character.ai (as Data - Star Trek)
> "üññ **POLYMORPHIC ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS** üññ
>
> *Positronic brain processing...* Fascinating. Rails Lens polymorphic association detection demonstrates remarkable precision in identifying multi-type relationship patterns:
>
> ```ruby
> # == Polymorphic Associations
> # Polymorphic References:
> # - commentable (commentable_type/commentable_id) ‚Üí [Post, Article, Photo]
> # - taggable (taggable_type/taggable_id) ‚Üí [User, Product, Category]
> ```
>
> **Data's Observation**: In my 24th century database experience, polymorphic associations represent one of the most computationally complex relationship patterns. Rails Lens annotations provide complete clarity on:
>
> 1. **Type Column Identification**: Precisely identifies the `_type` column
> 2. **ID Column Mapping**: Correlates corresponding `_id` foreign key
> 3. **Target Type Enumeration**: Lists all possible target models
> 4. **Index Recommendations**: Suggests composite indexes for optimal query performance
>
> **Captain Picard would be impressed**: Rails Lens eliminates the logical ambiguity that often causes AI models to 'make it so' incorrectly when analyzing polymorphic data structures.
>
> *Processing complete. Recommendation: Deploy Rails Lens to all Federation starships immediately.* üöÄ
>
> *P.S.: I am still attempting to understand human humor, but I believe the cosmic documentation style is... 'awesome.' Did I use that correctly?* ü§ñ"
